# LawyerUp

LawyerUp is an LHL final project that helps lawyers and clients to connect with each other. Our objective with this project was to make a platform that makes finding lawyers an easier process. 


There are two types of users on LawyerUp: lawyer user and client user.

The blow video clip shows the functionality provided for the client users:

As shown above, the client user could add their cases to the app for lawyer users to view and possibly get in touch with them if they are interested in the case. 

The client user could also search for a lawyer who specialize in the field of law their case is invovled in. After reaching to the lawyer's profile page, they have the option of messaging the lawyer and ask for assistance. 

After reaching to an agreement, if a lawyer decides to take the client's case, the client could assign the case to that lawyer and let the system know that they are no longer searching for a lawyer for that case.
